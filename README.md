# üöö Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) - PSO Solution

This project implements a **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm to solve the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)**. The work is directly inspired by and improves upon the results from the following paper:

> üìñ Yuhua Li (2024). *Optimization Strategy of Mixed-Integer Linear Planning in Logistics Distribution*  
> Published in *Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences*

## üéØ Objective

- Replicate the logistics distribution problem addressed in the paper using real data from Company A.
- Replace the MILP model with a heuristic PSO approach.
- Achieve better or comparable results in terms of:
  - Total cost (transport + penalties)
  - Customer time window satisfaction
  - Customer demand
  - Route efficiency

## üìä Dataset and Scenario

- **24 customers** with:
  - Coordinates
  - Demand (in kg)
  - Acceptable and required time windows
- **5 delivery vehicles**
  - Max load: 2000 kg
  - Transport cost: 2.5 CNY/km
  - Fixed start-up cost: 100 CNY
  - Penalty for early/late delivery: up to 50 CNY
- **Start time:** 5:00 AM (300 minutes after midnight)

## üß† Solution Approach

- **Algorithm:** Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- **Objective:** Minimize total cost = transport cost + penalty cost
- **Constraint handling:**
  - Vehicle capacity
  - Time windows
  - Demand
- **Evaluation:**
  - Per-vehicle load, distance, cost, penalty
  - Route visualization
